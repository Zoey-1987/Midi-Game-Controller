# Midi-Game-Controller
A little project to let me mess around with my midi keyboard as a computer input

The project is so nearly done, I'd just like to add some colour options and narration options for accessibility, and find a way to make the selected key and the keystroke display look a little nicer.
I'm going to busy this week but I'll do my best to complete it when I'm back. Then it's time to work on jeopardy ðŸ™ƒ
